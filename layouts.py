My group/workspace layouts.

The built in layouts can be found here:
    http://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/manual/ref/layouts.html

Look at porting some Xmonad layouts to qtile:
    https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib/blob/master/XMonad/Layout/Circle.hs
    https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib/blob/master/XMonad/Layout/Cross.hs

>>  Try cribbing from what the XmonadTall layout does:
